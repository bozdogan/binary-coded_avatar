# Binary-Coded Github-Like Avatar Creator (BinGA)

Enterprise-ready state-of-the-art avatar generator toolkit. Similar to an identicon, 
but the picture is created directly from binary code of given text. Hence, worse looking.
Currently under heavy agile development. All the known "design patterns" is going to be 
applied to the codebase eventually, even it they don't fit. We aim for Mobile-First 
Approach&trade;but currently don't have a UI/UX designer so we hired a Full-Stack Frontend 
designer who can barely design a Swing `JFrame`.

As you can see we're pretty fucked up. But we're not hopeless. We have hope. Some day
we will be the leading company in some niche area of consumer product and no one could
really complain because there will be no alternative to our shitty apps. Then the world 
will see how glorious the obfuscated code of ours is!!!1
